    "text": "Dozens of activist and legal groups, elected officials, local jurisdictions, and individuals have launched more than 70 lawsuits against the Trump administration since Jan 20 in response to his more than 60 executive orders, as well as executive proclamations and memos. Fox News Digital found that Trump long has been a legal target, which hit a fever pitch during the 2024 election cycle when Trump faced four criminal indictments, including a criminal trial in Manhattan in the spring of 2024, where he was found guilty on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump has maintained his innocence in the four cases, pointing to them as evidence of lawfare at the hands of Democrats working against his political efforts."
