    "text": "Fox News national correspondent Bryan Llenas has the latest on 19 states suing to stop DOGE from accessing certain information on ‘America Reports.’\nA\nfederal judge\non Friday granted an injunction requested by 19 attorneys general to prevent the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from having access to the Treasury Department's central payment system.\nThe ruling by U.S. District Judge Jeannette Vargas extends the pause by issuing a preliminary injunction, a legal step that blocks access to the records while the case is litigated on the merits.\nIn her 64-page decision, Vargas noted she was granting the preliminary injunction\npreventing DOGE\nfrom accessing the payment records because of the possible disclosure of the states’ bank records. However, she also said the plaintiffs \"have not demonstrated that they are entitled to the broad and sweeping relief they seek, which would far exceed the scope of the present TRO (Temporary restraining order).\"\nTRUMP ISSUES WARNING ABOUT WASTEFUL SPENDING, ORDERS 'RADICAL TRANSPARENCY' AMID DOGE PROBES, REVELATIONS\nThe White House on Wednesday outlined where Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) dividend checks could go after President Donald Trump floated the idea of giving 20% of the savings back to Americans.\n(Reuters | iStock | Getty Images)\nVargas is giving Trump administration attorneys the chance to fix any defects so that the sensitive information will be protected.\nA report is due March 24. Last week, a federal judge extended a temporary order to block DOGE from accessing Treasury payment systems.\nA lawsuit filed by the 19 AGs claims DOGE illegally accessed the Treasury Department’s central payment system at the Trump administration’s behest. The payment systems have information about Americans’ Social Security,\nMedicare and\nveterans’ benefits; tax refund information; and much more.\nLawyers for the administration argued that the temporary restraining order \"causes ongoing constitutional harm to the Treasury Department's ability to make management decisions within its lawful discretion.\"\nTREASURY ‘MISTAKENLY’ GAVE MUSK DOGE WORKER ABILITY TO CHANGE PAYMENTS SYSTEM: COURT DOCS\nThe U.S. Treasury building in Washington, D.C.\n(Reuters/Kevin Lamarque/File Photo)\nDefense attorneys argued that there is nothing unlawful about the Treasury Department's actions. Treasury officials have denied violating privacy laws, saying only two members of the DOGE team had been given \"read-only\" access to information in the payment systems.\nThe lawsuit was filed in\nNew York\nby the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James, a vocal Trump critic.\nIt includes attorneys general from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.\n\"We just won a court order stopping DOGE and unauthorized, unelected, and unvetted individuals like Elon Musk from accessing people's private data and blocking federal funds,\" James wrote Friday on X. \"We will keep fighting to protect all Americans from this administration’s destruction.\"\nThe AGs argue that granting DOGE access to the payment system puts Americans' sensitive, personal information, such as bank account details and Social Security numbers, at risk.\nFox News' William Mears and Maria Paronich contributed to this report."
